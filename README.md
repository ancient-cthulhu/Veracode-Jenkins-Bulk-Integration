# Veracode Security Pipeline for Jenkins / GitHub

Automated Veracode security scanning across GitHub organizations, delivered as a Jenkins Shared Library. Drop a 2-line `Jenkinsfile` into any repo and it gets SCA, IaC/secrets, and SAST on every push, beside the team's existing build.

## What it does

Every repo that opts in gets three scans running automatically:

| Scan | When | What it covers |
|------|------|----------------|
| **SCA** (Software Composition Analysis) | Default branch + PR builds | Open source dependencies and license risk |
| **IaC + Secrets** | Default branch + PR builds | Infrastructure misconfigurations and hardcoded secrets |
| **SAST + Policy** | Default branch only (post-merge) | First-party code, compiled and scanned against your Veracode policy |

A push to the webhook still triggers a Jenkins build for any branch, but SCA and IaC/secrets only run on the default branch and on PRs by default. Opt a repo into scanning every feature branch push with `veracodePipeline(scanFeatureBranches: true)`.

Scans run on a dedicated pipeline beside each team's build. No changes to existing CI. No risk to existing deployments. The only thing added to a product repo is a 2-line `Jenkinsfile`.

## How it works

```
GitHub org
  └── repo (any language)
        └── Jenkinsfile          ← 2 lines, added by PR
              │
              ▼
     Jenkins Organization Folder  ← auto-discovers repos via GitHub API
              │
              ▼
     veracode-pipeline library    ← all logic lives here, versioned by Git tag
              │
         ┌────┴────────────────┐
         ▼                     ▼
    SCA + IaC/Secrets        SAST (default branch)
    (every build)            Docker container auto-detects
                             language, compiles, packages,
                             uploads to Veracode platform
```

The shared library handles everything: Veracode CLI install, SCA agent download, Docker-based autopackaging, Java wrapper upload, GitHub commit status reporting. Repos stay clean.

## Rollout in 5 steps

1. **Run `rollout.py`** - creates the two platform repos, registers the library in Jenkins, configures credentials, runs onboarding
2. **Scan Organization** in Jenkins - discovers all repos in the org
3. **Merge Jenkinsfile PRs** - `bulk_add_jenkinsfile.py` opens them, teams merge them
4. Scanning starts automatically on the next push
5. Results appear in the Veracode platform.

The entire rollout touches no existing build pipelines and is reversible: `bulk_add_jenkinsfile.py --delete` opens PRs to remove the `Jenkinsfile` from every repo.

## Repository layout

```
library-repo/               → push as "veracode-pipeline" repo, tag v1
  vars/veracodePipeline.groovy    full pipeline: SCA, IaC, SAST (Linux + Windows)
  README.md                       usage, overrides, versioning, agent setup

platform-automation/        → push as "jenkins-platform" repo
  rollout.py / .sh / .ps1         one-shot setup script, three equivalent variants, edited in place (no secrets in the file)
  veracode-onboard.groovy         creates org folders, mints SCA tokens
  bulk_add_jenkinsfile.py         bulk PR rollout across orgs (--delete to reverse)
  jenkins.casc.yaml               JCasC alternative to rollout.py steps 2-3
  README.md                       step-by-step manual guide

consumer-repo-files/        → added to each scanned repo by the bulk-PR script
  Jenkinsfile                     2 lines
```

Per-repo tuning (source dir, app name, custom build steps, library version) is done directly in that repo's `Jenkinsfile` via `veracodePipeline(...)` config, not a separate config file. See `library-repo/README.md` for the full option list.

## What changes in your environment

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Product repos | Unchanged | +1 `Jenkinsfile` (2 lines) |
| Jenkins | Unchanged | +1 shared library, +1 org folder per scanned org |
| GitHub | Unchanged | +2 platform repos, +1 org webhook per scanned org |
| Veracode | Unchanged | +1 app profile per repo, +1 SCA workspace per org |

No agents are replaced. No existing pipelines are modified. No credentials are stored outside Jenkins.

---

## Requirements

- Jenkins with the Pipeline, GitHub Branch Source, Credentials Binding, and Docker Workflow plugins
- A GitHub PAT with `repo` and `read:org` scopes for the scan service account
- Veracode API credentials (ID + Key)
- Docker on Jenkins agents for SAST autopackaging (or pre-installed language toolchains)

See `SOLUTION.md` for the full architecture, credential scoping, agent requirements, and phased rollout plan.
